The exact format of output is up to you guys. Following is the sample output

WorkerID,Client_handled_id,Percentage_Of_Load
10,2,10%

The percentage of the load is the utilisation of the worker during the whole life-time of the server. Interested students can output these values in real-time, i.e. after a worker finishes a job from the client.
